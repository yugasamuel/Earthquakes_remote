# Earthquakes_remote
Tour of the app

Earthquakes is developed by following Apple's **SwiftUI** module. This project serves as a practical exercise to deepen my knowledge to load and manage data over the network in a SwiftUI app.

The United States Geological Survey (USGS) hosts a JSON feed of earthquake data. This module guides us through the development of Earthquakes, an iOS app that queries and presents this data. Hereâ€™s a closer look at what I build in this module:

## <span style="font-size:larger;">Earthquakes list</span>
The list displays a navigation view that contains all the earthquakes in the feed. Users can delete individual earthquakes. Tapping the Reload button refreshes the feed and reloads the earthquakes.

## <span style="font-size:larger;">Earthquake details</span>
The detail view shows more information about an earthquake, including a map of the region surrounding the earthquake. The app fetches and loads the coordinates for each earthquake on demand in the background when it displays the detail view.

## <span style="font-size:larger;">Earthquake data</span>
The USGS data contains many details for earth scientists. As an app for the general population, Earthquakes ignores most of those details and extracts six common properties of each earthquake: the name of the location, time, magnitude, latitude, longitude, and detail. Together, the latitude and longitude make up the geographical coordinates.

## <span style="font-size:larger;">Networking layer</span>
Earthquakes relies on a network client to load the earthquake data. The client performs network transfers concurrently in the background, keeping the interface responsive.
